Installation
============

Install the extension as normal in the Extension Manager. Depending on your TYPO3 version you will need to confirm the creation of the necessary database tables.

Configuration
=============

This extension is built using Extbase and Fluid. Thus the normal options of configuring storage folders or extracting the templates apply.

Adding the extension to a page gives you the choice of multiple output modes, namely „Upcoming Events“, „List of Events“ and „Calendar output“ and a „Details View“. The difference between the views is the way the events are being presented on the frontend.

Please note that the included default templates for the list mode and the upcoming mode are identical. You will not see a visual difference between these two modes unless you have more than 3 (or the configured amount) of events in your database.

All output options can be configured in the backend using flexforms. For the „Upcoming Events“ you can set the number of events to show (defaults to 3), for the „List of Events“ you can configure the number of years in the future you want to display. This defaults to one year which means that all events from today up to the same date one year from now will be displayed.

The following options are available for configuration by TypoScript:
