Note on Patches / Pull Requests
-------------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Commit, do not mess with ext_emconf.php, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself that can ignore when merging)
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Change Log
----------

All changes are documented in the `repository log`_. The main development happens in the develop branch which will be merged back into master once a new stable version is going to be published.
